# MacGyver
Python mini-game where MacGyver has to escape a maze

## Description

MacGuyver is once again in a sticky situation. 
To escape, he has to find a needle, a small plastic tube, and some ether that will allow him to craft a syringe and put the bad guy to sleep.
Be careful, for once the bad guy can shoot ;). If you get on the same location as the guardian without the syringe, MacGyver will die! Patty and Selma will be devastated...
